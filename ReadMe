This is a test file for new-learner of  orgnization!

When I create  a orgnization named "John-s-Test-Oranization",there's a commison:"set the branch ruleset!"
So I read an doc :https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches.
"Protected Branches" just means:the pull rule ,merge rule..etc. so I create the "Hello-World" repository from common member.
